üìù AWS Bedrock Blog Maker API
üìñ Overview
This project is a serverless API that:

Uses AWS Bedrock's LLaMA3-70b-instruct model to generate a 200-word blog on any topic.

Saves the generated blog into an S3 bucket as a .txt file.

Runs on AWS Lambda and is triggered via API Gateway.

Testable with tools like Postman.

üß† Workflow
API Gateway receives a POST request containing the blog_topic.

Lambda Handler invokes the Bedrock model (meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0) to generate a blog.

Generated blog is uploaded as a timestamped file into the specified S3 bucket.

Returns a 200 response indicating successful completion.
